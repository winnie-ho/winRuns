Summary of the energy performance related features of this home
This table sets out the results of the survey which lists the current energy - related features of this home.Each element
is assessed by the national calculation methodology; 1 star = very poor(least efficient), 2 stars = poor, 3 stars =
  average, 4 stars = good and 5 stars = very good(most efficient).The assessment does not take into consideration the
condition of an element and how well it is working.‘Assumed’ means that the insulation could not be inspected and an
assumption has been made in the methodology, based on age and type of construction.
Element Description Energy Efficiency Environmental
Walls Cavity wall, filled cavity
Roof Pitched, 300 mm loft insulation
Floor Suspended, no insulation(assumed)
Windows Fully double glazed
Main heating Boiler and radiators, mains gas
Main heating controls Programmer, TRVs and bypass
Secondary heating None
Hot water From main system, no cylinder thermostat
Lighting Low energy lighting in 50 % of fixed outlets
The energy efficiency rating of your home
Your Energy Efficiency Rating is calculated using the standard UK methodology, RdSAP.This calculates energy used
for heating, hot water, lighting and ventilation and then applies fuel costs to that energy use to give an overall rating
for your home.The rating is given on a scale of 1 to 100. Other than the cost of fuel for electrical appliances and for
cooking, a building with a rating of 100 would cost almost nothing to run.
As we all use our homes in different ways, the energy rating is calculated using standard occupancy assumptions
which may be different from the way you use it.The rating also uses national weather information to allow comparison
between buildings in different parts of Scotland.However, to make information more relevant to your home, local
weather data is used to calculate your energy use, CO2 emissions, running costs and the savings possible from making
improvements.
The impact of your home on the environment
One of the biggest contributors to global warming is carbon dioxide.The energy we use for heating, lighting and power
  in our homes produces over a quarter of the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions.Different fuels produce different amounts
of carbon dioxide for every kilowatt hour(kWh) of energy used.The Environmental Impact Rating of your home is
calculated by applying these 'carbon factors' for the fuels you use to your overall energy use.
The calculated emissions for your home are 43 kg CO2 / m²/yr.
The average Scottish household produces about 6 tonnes of carbon dioxide every year.Based on this assessment,
  heating and lighting this home currently produces approximately 5.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide every year.Adopting
recommendations in this report can reduce emissions and protect the environment.If you were to install all of these
recommendations this could reduce emissions by 1.9 tonnes per year.You could reduce emissions even more by
switching to renewable energy sources.

About the recommended measures to improve your home’s performance rating
This section offers additional information and advice on the recommended improvement measures for your home
1 Floor insulation(suspended floor)
Insulation of a floor will significantly reduce heat loss; this will improve levels of comfort, reduce energy use and
lower fuel bills.Suspended floors can often be insulated from below but must have adequate ventilation to
prevent dampness; seek advice about this if unsure.Further information about floor insulation is available from
many sources including www.energysavingtrust.org.uk / scotland / Insulation / Floor - insulation.Building regulations
generally apply to this work so it is best to check with your local authority building standards department.
2 Low energy lighting
Replacement of traditional light bulbs with energy saving bulbs will reduce lighting costs over the lifetime of the
bulb, and they last many times longer than ordinary light bulbs.Low energy lamps and fittings are now
commonplace and readily available.Information on energy efficiency lighting can be found from a wide range of
organisations, including the Energy Saving Trust(http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/home-energyefficiency/lighting).
  3 Solar water heating
A solar water heating panel, usually fixed to the roof, uses the sun to pre - heat the hot water supply.This can
significantly reduce the demand on the heating system to provide hot water and hence save fuel and money.
Planning permission might be required, building regulations generally apply to this work and a building warrant
may be required, so it is best to check these with your local authority.You could be eligible for Renewable Heat
Incentive payments which could appreciably increase the savings beyond those shown on your EPC, provided
that both the product and the installer are certified by the Microgeneration Certification Scheme(or equivalent).
Details of local MCS installers are available at www.microgenerationcertification.org.
4 Solar photovoltaic(PV) panels
A solar PV system is one which converts light directly into electricity via panels placed on the roof with no waste
and no emissions.This electricity is used throughout the home in the same way as the electricity purchased from
an energy supplier.Planning permission might be required, building regulations generally apply to this work and
a building warrant may be required, so it is best to check with your local authority.The assessment does not
include the effect of any Feed -in Tariff which could appreciably increase the savings that are shown on this EPC
for solar photovoltaic panels, provided that both the product and the installer are certified by the Microgeneration
Certification Scheme(or equivalent).Details of local MCS installers are available at
www.microgenerationcertification.org.
Low and zero carbon energy sources
Your home's heat demand
You could receive Renewable Heat Incentive(RHI) payments and help reduce carbon emissions by replacing your
existing heating system with one that generates renewable heat and, where appropriate, having your loft insulated and
cavity walls filled.The estimated energy required for space and water heating will form the basis of the payments.For

PART 1 - GENERAL
1.1 THE SURVEYORS
The Seller has engaged the Surveyors to provide the Single Survey Report and a generic Mortgage
Valuation Report for Lending Purposes.The Seller has also engaged the Surveyors to provide an
Energy Report in the format prescribed by the accredited Energy Company.
The Surveyors are authorised to provide a transcript or retype of the generic Mortgage Valuation
Report on to Lender specific pro - forma.Transcript reports are commonly requested by Brokers and
Lenders.The transcript report will be in the format required by the Lender but will contain the same
information, inspection date and valuation figure as the generic Mortgage Valuation Report and the
Single Survey.The Surveyors will decline any transcript request which requires the provision of
information additional to the information in the Report and the generic Mortgage Valuation Report until
the Seller has conditionally accepted an offer to purchase made in writing.
Once the Seller has conditionally accepted an offer to purchase made in writing, the Purchaser's
lender or conveyancer may request that the Surveyors provide general comment on standard
appropriate supplementary documentation.In the event of a significant amount of documentation
being provided to the Surveyors, an additional fee may be incurred by the Purchaser.Any additional
fee will be agreed in writing.
If information is provided to the Surveyors during the conveyancing process which materially affects
the valuation stated in the Report and generic Mortgage Valuation Report, the Surveyors reserve the
right to reconsider the valuation.Where the Surveyors require to amend the valuation in consequence
of such information, they will issue an amended Report and generic Mortgage Valuation Report to the
Seller.It is the responsibility of the Seller to ensure that the amended Report and generic Mortgage
Valuation Report are transmitted to every prospective Purchaser.
The individual Surveyor will be a member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors who is
competent to survey, value and report upon Residential Property.
If the Surveyors have had a previous business relationship within the past two years with the Seller or
Sellers Agent or relative to the property, they will be obliged to indicate this by ticking the adjacent box.
The Surveyors have a written complaints handling procedure.This is available from the offices of the
Surveyors at the address stated.
THE REPORT
The Surveyors will not provide an amended Report on the Property, except to correct factual
inaccuracies.
The Report will identify the nature and source of information relied upon in its preparation.
The Surveyor shall provide a Market Value of the Property, unless the condition of the Property is such
that it would be inappropriate to do so.A final decision on whether a loan will be granted rests with the
Lender who may impose retentions in line with their lending criteria.The date of condition and value
of the property will be the date of inspection.
To date, Purchasers have normally obtained their own report from their chosen Surveyor.By contrast,
  a Single Survey is instructed by the Seller and made available to all potential Purchasers in the
expectation that the successful Purchaser will have relied upon it.The Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors rules require disclosure of any potential conflict of interest when acting for the Seller and
the Purchaser in the same transaction.The Single Survey may give rise to a conflict of interest and if
this is of concern to any party they are advised to seek their own independent advice.

Purchaser or any other person in relation to an asking price or any other sales or marketing decisions.
The Report is based solely on the Property and is not to be relied upon in any manner whatsoever
when considering the valuation or condition of any other property.
If certain minor matters are mentioned in the Report it should not be assumed that the Property is free
of other minor defects.
Neither the whole nor any part of the Report may be published in any way, reproduced or distributed
by any party other than the Seller, prospective purchasers and the Purchaser and their respective
professional advisers without the prior written consent of the Surveyors.
  LIABILITY
The Report is prepared with the skill and care reasonably to be expected of a competent residential
surveyor who is a member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The Report is addressed to the Seller and was prepared in the expectation that it(or a complete copy)
along with these Terms and Conditions(or a complete copy) would(or, as the case might be, would
have been) be disclosed and delivered to: -
  The Surveyors acknowledge that their duty of skill and care in relation to the Report is owed to the
Seller and to the Purchaser.The Surveyors accept no responsibility or liability whatsoever in relation
to the Report to persons other than the Seller and the Purchaser.The Seller and Purchaser should be
aware that if a Lender seeks to rely on this Report they do so at their own risk.In particular, the
Surveyors accept no responsibility or liability whatsoever to any Lender in relation to the Report.Any
such Lender relies upon the Report entirely at their own risk.
GENERIC MORTGAGE VALUATION REPORT
The Surveyors undertake to the Seller that they will prepare a generic Mortgage Valuation Report,
  which will be issued along with the Single Survey.It is the responsibility of the Seller to ensure that
the generic Mortgage Valuation Report is provided to every potential Purchaser.
TRANSCRIPT MORTGAGE VALUATION FOR LENDING PURPOSES
The Surveyors undertake that on being asked to do so by a prospective purchaser, or his / her
professional advisor or Lender, they will prepare a Transcript Mortgage Valuation Report for Lending
Purposes on terms and conditions to be agreed between the Surveyors and Lender and solely for the
use of the Lender and upon which the Lender may rely.The decision as to whether finance will be
provided is entirely a matter for the Lender.The Transcript Mortgage Valuation Report will be from
information contained in the Report and the generic Mortgage Valuation Report.

The Surveyor will not carry out an asbestos inspection, and will not be acting as an asbestos inspector
  in completing a Single Survey of properties that may fall within the Control of Asbestos in the
Workplace Regulations.In the case of flats it will be assumed that there is a duty holder, as defined in
  the Regulations and that a Register of Asbestos and effective Management Plan is in place, which
does not require any expenditure, or pose a significant risk to health.No enquiry of the duty holder will
be made.
THE REPORT
The Report will be prepared by the Surveyor who carried out the property inspection and will describe
various aspects of the property as defined by the headings of the Single Survey report with the
comments being general and unbiased.The report on the location, style and condition of the property,
  will be concise and will be restricted to matters that could have a material effect upon value and will
omit items that, in the Surveyor's opinion, are not significant. If certain minor matters are mentioned, it
should not be interpreted that the property is free of any other minor defects.
Throughout the report, the following repair categories will be used to give an overall opinion of the
state of repair and condition of the property.
  WARNING:
If left unattended, even for a relatively short period, Category 2 repairs can rapidly develop into more
serious Category 3 repairs.The existence of Category 2 or Category 3 repairs may have an adverse
effect on marketability, value and the sale price ultimately achieved for the property.This is
particularly true during slow market conditions when the effect can be considerable.
Parts of the property, which cannot be seen or accessed, will not be reported upon and this will be
stated.If the Surveyor suspects that a defect may exist within an unexposed area and which could
have a material effect upon the value, he may recommend further investigation by specialist
contractors.
  SERVICES
Surveyors are not equipped or qualified to test the services and therefore no comment can be
interpreted as implying that the design, installation and function of the services are in
  accordance / compliance with regulations, safety and efficiency expectations.However, comment is
made where there is cause to suspect significant defects or shortcomings with the installations.No
tests are made of any services or appliances.
  ACCESSIBILITY

ENERGY REPORT
A section is included that makes provision for an Energy Report, relative to the property.The
Surveyor will collect physical data from the property and provide such data in a format required by an
accredited Energy Company.The Surveyor cannot of course accept liability for any advice given by
the Energy Company.
VALUATION AND CONVEYANCER ISSUES
The last section of the Report contains matters considered relevant to the Conveyancer(Solicitor).It
also contains the Surveyor's opinion both of the market value of the property and of the re-instatement
cost, as defined below.
"Market Value" is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation
between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's-length transaction after proper marketing
wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.In arriving at
the opinion of the Market Value, the Surveyor also makes various standard assumptions covering, for
example, vacant possession; tenure and other legal considerations; contamination and hazardous
materials; the condition of un - inspected parts; the right to use mains services; and the exclusion of
curtains, carpets etc.from the valuation.In the case of flats, the following further assumptions are
made that:
Any additional assumption, or any found not to apply, is reported.
"Re-instatement cost" is an estimate for insurance purposes of the current cost of rebuilding the
Property in its present form unless otherwise stated.This includes the cost of rebuilding the garage
and permanent outbuildings, site clearance and professional fees, but excludes VAT(except on the
fees).
Sellers or prospective Purchasers may consider it prudent to instruct a reinspection and revaluation
after a period of 12 weeks(or sooner if appropriate) to reflect changing circumstances in the market
and / or in the physical condition of the Property.

the previous comments for detailed information.
  Remember
The cost of repairs may influence the amount someone is prepared to pay for the property.We recommend that
relevant estimates and reports are obtained in your own name.
  Warning
If left unattended, even for a relatively short period, Category 2 repairs can rapidly develop into more serious
Category 3 repairs.The existence of Category 2 or Category 3 repairs may have an adverse effect on marketability,
  value and the sale price ultimately achieved for the property.This is particularly true during slow market conditions
where the effect can be considerable.

Guidance notes on accessibility information
Three steps or fewer to a main entrance door of the property:
In flatted developments the 'main entrance' would be the flat's own entrance door, not the external door to the
communal stair.The 'three steps or fewer' are counted from external ground level to the flat's entrance door. Where
a lift is present, the count is based on the number of steps climbed when using the lift.
Unrestricted parking within 25 metres:
For this purpose, 'Unrestricted parking' includes parking available by means of a parking permit.Restricted parking
includes parking that is subject to parking restrictions, as indicated by the presence of solid yellow, red or white lines
at the edge of the road or by a parking control sign, parking meters or other coin - operated machines.

During our inspection we noted alterations appear to have taken place and whilst not an exhaustive list these
include the layout at ground floor level, including French doors.
Where defects or repairs have been identified within this report it is recommended that, prior to entering into any
legally binding sale or purchase contract, further specialist's or contractor's advice and estimates should be
obtained, to establish the implications, if any, on a potential offer to purchase or the sale price likely to be
achieved for the property.
For Reinstatement Cost Assessment purposes, it is recommended that the subjects be insured for a sum of not
less than £305, 000(THREE HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING).
This figure is the estimate of the cost of rebuilding the premises and bears no direct relationship to current market
value.
Having considered matters, taking account of our general observations on site, we are of the opinion that the
Market Value of the subjects in their present condition and with the benefit of vacant possession may be fairly
stated in the sum of £420, 000(FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING).
Property market activity has been impacted due to the current response to Covid - 19. We are faced with an
unprecedented set of circumstances on which to make a valuation judgement.Our advice is therefore reported
on the basis of material valuation uncertainty as per the RICS Red Book Global definition.Consequently, less
certainty can be attached to our valuation than would otherwise be the case.It is recommended that the valuation
of this property is kept under frequent review as more market evidence becomes available.
